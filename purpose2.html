    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <h6> As coders, we created a website only about gun violence in America to spread awareness in hopes that we can help suppress this prevalent issue that is taking innocent lives across the country. Although the subject of guns and weapons may be a political subject, we are approaching gun violence on a stance to save lives and not in support of any political party. Through hard facts and statistics, hopefully we can change this country by stopping these tragic events from happening again. Thank you for visiting our website, and to support our cause, please share our webpage!
